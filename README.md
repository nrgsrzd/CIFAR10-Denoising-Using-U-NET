# CIFAR10 Denoising Using U-NET
This project implements convolutional neural networks and Unet on cifar10 dataset. It includes four parts, where the accuracy is increased through various techniques, and attention mechanisms are used to enhance the Unet network.
I implemented a U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms for denoising images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal was to improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the denoised images by utilizing attention mechanisms.
